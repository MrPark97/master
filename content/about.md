# THE FALL OF ROME

## WYSTAN HUGH AUDEN

The piers are pummelled by the waves;  
In a lonely field the rain  
Lashes an abandoned train;  
Outlaws fill the mountain caves.

Fantastic grow the evening gowns;  
Agents of the Fisc pursue  
Absconding tax-defaulters through  
The sewers of provincial towns.  

Private rites of magic send  
The temple prostitutes to sleep;  
All the literati keep  
An imaginary friend.

Cerebrotonic Cato may  
Extol the Ancient Disciplines,  
But the muscle-bound Marines  
Mutiny for food and pay.

Caesarâ€™s double-bed is warm  
As an unimportant clerk  
Writes I DO NOT LIKE MY WORK  
On a pink official form.

Unendowed with wealth or pity,  
Little birds with scarlet legs,  
Sitting on their speckled eggs,  
Eye each flu-infected city.

Altogether elsewhere, vast  
Herds of reindeer move across  
Miles and miles of golden moss,  
Silently and very fast.
